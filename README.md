### SUPPORTED ENVIRONMENTS:

* [The Expo run commands](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/) (`expo run:[android|ios]`)

---

### INSTALL

You need both packages: `pushwoosh-expo-plugin` (the config plugin, applied at prebuild)
and `pushwoosh-react-native-plugin` (the runtime SDK you call from JS).

```bash
npx expo install pushwoosh-expo-plugin pushwoosh-react-native-plugin
```

### CONFIGURATION IN app.json / app.config.js
## 
### Plugin

Add the plugin to the front of the plugin array.

```javascript
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "pushwoosh-expo-plugin",
      {
        "mode": "development",
      }
    ]
  ]
}

```
### Plugin Prop
You can pass prop to the plugin config object to configure:

| Plugin prop |              |                                                                               |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mode`       | **required** | iOS only — configures the [APNs environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/aps-environment) entitlement. `"development"` or `"production"`. Has no effect on Android. |

#### iOS Props
The following props can be configured under the `ios` key:

| iOS props | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PW_API_TOKEN` | Yes | `__YOUR_API_TOKEN__` | Your Pushwoosh API token for iOS. You can get the API token in the Pushwoosh control panel (Select an app -> "Settings" -> "API access" |
| `Pushwoosh_LOG_LEVEL` | No | `INFO` | Log level for iOS. Possible values: `NONE`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `NOISE` |

> **Note**: Remote notifications in Background Modes are automatically configured in the Signing & Capabilities section through the `withEntitlementsPlist` function. You don't need to manually configure this in Info.plist.

#### Android Props
The following props can be configured under the `android` key:

| Android props | Required | Default | Description |
|---------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `apiToken` | Yes | `__YOUR_API_TOKEN__` | Your Pushwoosh API token for Android. You can get the API token in the Pushwoosh control panel (Select an app -> "Settings" -> "API access" |
| `logLevel` | No | `INFO` | Log level for Android. One of: `NONE`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `NOISE` |
| `multiNotificationMode` | No | `true` | Can be changed to false in case you want to display only the last notification for the user |
| `icon` | No | - | Path to a custom notification icon for Android |

### Example Configuration
Here's an example of how to configure the plugin in your `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "pushwoosh-expo-plugin",
        {
          "mode": "development",
          "ios": {
            "PW_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
            "Pushwoosh_LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"
          },
          "android": {
            "apiToken": "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
            "logLevel": "DEBUG",
            "icon": "./assets/notification-icon.png"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Android: Firebase (FCM) setup

Android delivery goes through Firebase Cloud Messaging, so the app needs a
`google-services.json`. The config plugin does **not** add it for you:

1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) open (or create) the
   project whose FCM credentials are connected to your Pushwoosh app
   (Pushwoosh control panel → your app → Android/Firebase configuration).
2. Register an Android app in that Firebase project whose **package name matches** the
   `android.package` you use in `app.json`, then download its `google-services.json`.
3. Put the file in your project and point Expo at it via `android.googleServicesFile`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourcompany.yourapp",
      "googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json"
    }
  }
}
```

During `expo prebuild` Expo copies the file into the native project and applies the
`com.google.gms.google-services` Gradle plugin automatically. Without it Firebase cannot
initialize, no push token is registered, and notifications silently never arrive.

On Android 13+ the SDK requests the `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` runtime permission on first launch.

### Initialize Pushwoosh

```javascript
import Pushwoosh from 'pushwoosh-react-native-plugin';
```

```javascript
// pw_appid — your Pushwoosh Application Code (e.g. "XXXXX-XXXXX"),
// from the Pushwoosh control panel → your app → Settings.
Pushwoosh.init({ pw_appid: 'YOUR_PUSHWOOSH_APP_CODE' });
Pushwoosh.register();
```

> The FCM Sender ID is read from `google-services.json` (Android) — do **not** pass a
> `project_number` to `init`; that legacy GCM parameter is no longer used.

See the [Pushwoosh React Native](https://docs.pushwoosh.com/platform-docs/pushwoosh-sdk/cross-platform-frameworks/react-native/integrating-react-native-plugin) integration guide for the full JS API.

##
### Prebuild (optional)

Prebuilding within Expo entails the generation of native runtime code for the project, resulting in the construction of the 'ios' and 'android' directories. Through prebuilding, the native modules that utilize CocoaPods, autolinking, and other configuration plugins are automatically linked and configured. You can conceptualize prebuild as a bundler for native code.

Executing expo prebuild initiates a custom managed workflow that combines the advantages of both bare workflows and managed workflows simultaneously.

Why is prebuilding recommended?

Prebuilding locally can be beneficial for inspecting changes in config plugins and assisting in the debugging of issues.

### Running

```bash
npx expo prebuild

```

### RUN
##
Executing the provided commands will prebuild and run your application. It's important to note that push notifications will not function in the iOS Simulator.

```bash

# Build and run your native iOS project
npx expo run:ios

# Build and run your native Android project
npx expo run:android

```
